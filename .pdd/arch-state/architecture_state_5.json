    "1": "Perfect! I've successfully analyzed the PRD and posted my findings to GitHub issue #5.\n\n## Summary\n\nI've completed Step 1 of the architecture workflow by:\n\n1. **Extracting structured information** from the PRD including:\n   - Project title: Email Frontend\n   - Core features: Email input page, navigation, search query page, and implied email distribution\n   - Tech stack: All unspecified but requirements inferred from functionality\n\n2. **Identifying significant gaps**:\n   - No specified tech stack\n   - Unclear email storage and authentication model\n   - Search functionality details missing\n   - Recipient database source undefined\n   - No non-functional requirements (security, performance, scalability)\n\n3. **Assessment**: While the PRD is brief, it contains enough functional requirements to proceed with architecture generation. The workflow can move to Step 2 for deeper analysis.\n\nThe analysis has been posted as a comment on issue #5 and is ready for the next step in the workflow.",
    "2": "Perfect! I've successfully completed Step 2 of the architecture workflow and posted the deep analysis to GitHub issue #5.\n\n## Summary\n\nI've performed a comprehensive deep analysis of the PRD by:\n\n1. **Feature Decomposition**: Broke down the requirements into 4 core features with their functional units:\n   - Email Input Page\n   - Page Navigation\n   - Search Query Page\n   - Email Distribution (implied)\n\n2. **Identified 6 Module Candidates**:\n   - EmailInputModule (foundational)\n   - NavigationModule (foundational)\n   - SearchModule (dependent)\n   - EmailSenderModule (dependent)\n   - ValidationModule (foundational utility)\n   - ApiClientModule (foundational utility)\n\n3. **Analyzed Shared Concerns**: Authentication patterns, error handling, validation, logging, and configuration management\n\n4. **Tech Stack Assessment**: Marked as **Tech Stack Ambiguous** since the PRD doesn't specify technologies. Listed viable options for:\n   - Frontend frameworks (React, Vue, Next.js)\n   - Backend options (Node.js, Python, Serverless)\n   - Email services (SendGrid, AWS SES, Nodemailer)\n   - Database choices (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Elasticsearch)\n\n5. **Mapped Inter-Module Interfaces**: Defined how each module communicates with others\n\nThe analysis is now posted on issue #5 and ready for Step 3 (Research) of the workflow."
