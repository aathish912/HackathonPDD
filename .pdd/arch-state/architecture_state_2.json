    "1": "Perfect! I've successfully analyzed the PRD and posted my findings to GitHub issue #2. Here's a summary of what I found:\n\n## Analysis Complete\n\nThe PRD is minimal but sufficient to proceed with architecture design. While it's a simple one-sentence requirement, it does specify:\n\n**Core Feature:** A web application with a counter button that increments by one each click.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n- The requirements are basic but actionable\n- No tech stack is specified, leaving implementation choices open\n- Multiple architectural ambiguities exist (persistence, initial value, styling, deployment)\n- The simplicity suggests a client-side only solution may be appropriate\n\n**Status:** Analysis Complete (not \"PRD Content Insufficient\") because despite being brief, it provides enough information to design a basic architecture. The next steps can make reasonable assumptions about technology choices and implementation details.\n\nThe analysis has been posted to the GitHub issue and the workflow can proceed to Step 2: Deep Analysis."
