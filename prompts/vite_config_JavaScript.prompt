You are tasked with creating a Vite configuration file for a React frontend application that defines build tooling and development server setup.

Requirements
1. Configure Vite with the React plugin (@vitejs/plugin-react) to enable React support with Fast Refresh
2. Set up development server configuration with port 3000 (configurable via server.port)
3. Define build output directory as 'dist' (configurable via build.outDir)
4. Include module resolution settings for proper path aliasing and imports
5. Ensure the configuration is production-ready with optimized build settings
6. Follow Vite best practices for React project configuration
7. Keep the configuration minimal and focused on essential settings

Instructions
- Export a default Vite configuration object using defineConfig from 'vite'
- Import and register @vitejs/plugin-react in the plugins array
- Configure server.port to 3000 for local development
- Set build.outDir to 'dist' for production builds
- Add resolve.alias if needed for @ path mapping to src directory
- Keep the configuration clean and well-commented for maintainability
- Ensure compatibility with React 18+ features
- The configuration file should be at the root level (vite.config.js)

Deliverable
- A complete vite.config.js file at the project root
- Configuration should enable React development with hot module replacement
- Build configuration optimized for production deployment
- Clear, maintainable code following JavaScript ES modules syntax

Implementation assumptions (explicit)
- Using @vitejs/plugin-react for React support (not @vitejs/plugin-react-swc)
- Development server runs on port 3000 by default
- Build output goes to dist/ directory
- Modern JavaScript syntax (ES modules) is supported

Please produce production-ready code that implements the Vite configuration as specified above.
