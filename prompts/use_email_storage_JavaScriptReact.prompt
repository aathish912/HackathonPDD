You are tasked with creating a custom React hook that manages email storage and retrieval via browser localStorage for persistent user email data.

Requirements
1. Export a custom hook named useEmailStorage that manages email state
2. Return an object with three properties: email (current value), setEmail (setter function), and clearEmail (clear function)
3. Persist email to localStorage using the key 'userEmail'
4. Sync state with localStorage on mount and when email changes
5. Handle edge cases: missing localStorage, invalid JSON, null values
6. Use React.useState for managing the current email state
7. Use React.useEffect for syncing with localStorage
8. Return type signature: { email: string | null, setEmail: (email: string) => void, clearEmail: () => void }

Instructions
- Import useState and useEffect from 'react'
- Initialize state with useState, reading from localStorage on mount
- Implement setEmail function that:
  - Updates React state
  - Saves to localStorage.setItem('userEmail', email)
- Implement clearEmail function that:
  - Sets state to null
  - Removes from localStorage.removeItem('userEmail')
- Use useEffect to load email from localStorage on initial mount
- Handle localStorage.getItem returning null gracefully
- The hook should be a named export: export function useEmailStorage()
- File location: src/hooks/use-email-storage.jsx
- Use functional programming patterns for clean, testable code
- Handle browser environments where localStorage might not be available (try/catch)

Deliverable
- A complete use-email-storage.jsx file at src/hooks/
- Custom hook exporting useEmailStorage function
- Proper localStorage integration with error handling
- Clean, readable code with consistent state management

Implementation assumptions (explicit)
- Using React 18+ with hooks
- localStorage is available in the browser (with fallback for SSR/errors)
- Email is stored as plain string (not serialized JSON object)
- Hook can be used in multiple components without conflicts

Please produce production-ready code that implements the email storage hook as specified above.
