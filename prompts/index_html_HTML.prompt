You are tasked with creating the main HTML entry point file that serves as the root document for mounting the React application.

Requirements
1. Create a valid HTML5 document structure with proper DOCTYPE and meta tags
2. Include a root div element with id="root" for React to mount the application
3. Add essential meta tags for responsive design (viewport) and character encoding (UTF-8)
4. Set an appropriate page title for the application
5. Include script reference to the main.jsx entry point using type="module"
6. Keep the HTML minimal and semantic, as React will handle the UI rendering
7. Ensure the HTML is accessible and follows modern web standards

Dependencies
None - this is the HTML entry point that loads the React application

Instructions
- Start with `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration
- Use `<html lang="en">` for language specification
- In the `<head>` section:
  - Add `<meta charset="UTF-8" />` for character encoding
  - Add viewport meta tag: `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />`
  - Set a descriptive `<title>` (e.g., "Email Task App" or similar)
- In the `<body>` section:
  - Add a single `<div id="root"></div>` element where React will mount
  - Add script tag: `<script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"></script>`
- Keep the body content minimal - React will populate the root div
- Ensure proper indentation and formatting for readability
- The file should be at the project root (index.html)

Deliverable
- A complete index.html file at the project root
- Valid HTML5 structure with all required meta tags
- Root div element properly configured for React mounting
- Script reference to main.jsx entry point with type="module"

Implementation assumptions (explicit)
- Vite will process the script tag and bundle the application
- React 18+ will use ReactDOM.createRoot to mount to #root
- The main.jsx file exists at /src/main.jsx
- Modern browsers with ES module support are targeted

Please produce production-ready HTML content as specified above.
