You are tasked with creating an NPM package.json manifest file that defines project dependencies, metadata, and build scripts for a React + Vite application.

Requirements
1. Set a descriptive project name (required string field)
2. Set initial version to "1.0.0" or appropriate semantic version (required string field)
3. Define npm scripts for development, build, and preview (required object field)
4. Include React and React Router as production dependencies
5. Include Vite and related dev dependencies (@vitejs/plugin-react)
6. Specify "type": "module" for ES modules support
7. Include all necessary scripts: dev (start dev server), build (production build), preview (preview build)
8. Follow NPM package.json schema and best practices

Dependencies
None - this is a configuration file that defines project dependencies

Instructions
- Create a valid JSON package.json file with all required fields
- Set "name" field to a descriptive package name (e.g., "email-task-app")
- Set "version" to "1.0.0" for initial release
- Set "type" to "module" to enable ES module syntax
- Add "private": true to prevent accidental publication
- Define "scripts" object with:
  - "dev": "vite" - starts development server
  - "build": "vite build" - creates production build
  - "preview": "vite preview" - previews production build locally
- Add "dependencies" with:
  - "react": "^18.2.0" or latest stable
  - "react-dom": "^18.2.0" or latest stable
  - "react-router-dom": "^6.0.0" or latest stable
- Add "devDependencies" with:
  - "vite": "^5.0.0" or latest stable
  - "@vitejs/plugin-react": compatible version
- Ensure all version specifications use ^ for minor version flexibility

Deliverable
- A complete package.json file at the project root
- Valid JSON syntax with all required fields
- Scripts configured for Vite development workflow
- All necessary dependencies for React + React Router + Vite stack

Implementation assumptions (explicit)
- Using React 18+ for concurrent features
- Using React Router v6 for client-side routing
- Using Vite 5+ for build tooling
- Project is private and not intended for npm publication
- ES module syntax is preferred

Please produce production-ready package.json content as specified above.
